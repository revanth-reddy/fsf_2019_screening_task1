# fsf_2019_screening_task1

Hi! This is the screening task for  **Python fossee Summer Fellowship 2019**. It's a Task Manager app in **Django** .


## Prerequisites

After cloning the repo, install the dependencies present in requirements.txt file using the following command :

```
pip3 -r install requirements.txt
```
## Running the Application
I have used a virtual environment called **myvenv**. 
```
To activate virtual environment use following command in the homedirectory:
> source myvenv/bin/activate
```
To activate it 
There's already a database included in the repo ( db.sqlite3 ). So, there's no need of migrations. You can directly run the server using :
```
> python3 manage.py runserver
```
